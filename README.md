# PROHI Dashboard Example

**Author**: Xue WU

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple **multipage Streamlit web dashboard** developed as part of the DSHI course individual assignment.  
The app demonstrates how to build interactive dashboards with basic input widgets, data tables, and visualizations.

The dashboard includes the following pages:
- **Dashboard**: interactive controls (3+ input widgets), a synthetic dataset preview, and an Altair line chart.  
- **Prediction**: a simplified form that collects patient information (age, sex, cholesterol) and displays a demo submission result.  
- **About**: project summary and author information.
